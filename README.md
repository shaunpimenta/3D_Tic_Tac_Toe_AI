## Idea Description: 

Tic Tac Toe in three dimensions, usually referred to as 3D Tic Tac Toe or just TTT3D, is a game that is played on a 3x3x3 grid. Getting three in a row in any direction across the three dimensions is the game's goal.
Two players or a player and a computer compete in the game, and they alternate placing their symbols on the board. X is used by the first player, and O by the second. The board is blank when the game begins.A player makes a move by picking a cell on the board and inserting their symbol there. The game goes on until either all of the board's cells are occupied, or until one player gets three consecutive moves in any direction.One of the intriguing aspects of TTT3D is how it increases the complexity of the game by requiring players to consider three dimensions in addition to the usual two. This increases the number of possible move combinations, which increases the difficulty and interest level of the game.

## Abstract:

Our goal is to develop a fun 3D AI Tic Tac Toe game for the user.The goal of the game is to arrange three of your own markers in a straight line within the 3D board in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is played by two players, who alternately take turns placing their markers on open spaces on the board.The AI version of the game involves a computer program that uses artificial intelligence techniques to play the game against a human opponent. The AI program is designed to evaluate the game board and make intelligent decisions about where to place its next marker in order to increase its chances of winning the game.Game invloves Strategic thinking i.e a player has to think strategically and anticipate their opponentâ€™s moves,Brain Exercise i.e,improves cognitive abilities.The Novelty of our game is a unique and uncommon game which makes it more exciting and interesting to play than the traditional two-dimensional version.

##Algorithm

We will mostly go with Minimax along with alpha beta pruning so as to get a more efficient and faster solution
